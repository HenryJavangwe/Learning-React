I am sitting in my lounge with my windows but the air is still. \n\nIt's really hot in here and the heat is making me want to take my mattress and sleep outside but then when I think of the mosquitoes, spiders and/ snakes which are now highly active, I am immediately discourage.\n\nHow tiresome\n\n:(",
